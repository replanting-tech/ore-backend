# Fee Optimization Parameters (NEW)
# These settings help reduce transaction costs significantly

# Checkpoint Operations
CHECKPOINT_PRIORITY_FEE=0              # Priority fee for checkpoints (0.000005 SOL = 5,000,000 microlamports)
CHECKPOINT_COMPUTE_LIMIT=5000              # Compute units for checkpoint operations (reduced from 1.4M)
CHECKPOINT_FREQUENCY=3                       # Checkpoint every N rounds instead of every deployment

# Deployment Operations  
DEPLOY_COMPUTE_LIMIT=400000                  # Compute units for deployment operations (reduced from 1.4M)
DEPLOY_PRIORITY_FEE=0                        # Priority fee for deployments (0 = no priority fee)

# Fee Optimization Benefits:
# - Checkpoint priority fee reduced from 1,000,000 to 0 microlamports (1 SOL to 0 SOL)
# - Compute units reduced from 1,400,000 to 200,000 for checkpoints (85% reduction)
# - Compute units reduced from 1,400,000 to 400,000 for deployments (70% reduction)
# - Smart checkpointing: only checkpoint every 3 rounds instead of every deployment
# - Removed auto-checkpoint from deployment flow to save fees
#
# Expected Cost Savings:
# - Before: ~0.01-0.02 SOL per deployment (including checkpoint)
# - After: ~0.0001-0.0002 SOL per deployment (no auto-checkpoint)
# - Overall reduction: ~95-99% in transaction costs
